# LCG
In the name of good ... American mathematician D. H. Lehmer used Neumann's idea and introduced a method called "Linear Congruential Generator" in 1949. This method is called LCG for short.   In this regard, mod means calculating the remainder of dividing (aR_n+b) by m. In this case, a is the coefficient and b is the increase rate.
